# Changelog

All notable changes to BlockRun, newest first — gateway endpoints, model lineup, pricing, and SDK releases.

## [2026-06-28]

### Added — `response_format: json_schema` (OpenAI structured outputs)
- **`/v1/chat/completions`** now accepts `response_format: {"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{…}}` and forwards it verbatim. Schema-guaranteed output is enforced natively on OpenAI (GPT) models; other providers receive it on a best-effort passthrough. Previously only `json_object`/`text` were accepted (any other `type` returned a `400`).
- The `thinking` block is also accepted more leniently: `{"type":"disabled"}` and blocks without `budget_tokens` no longer `400`.

---

## [2026-06-24]

### Added — Real 4K on Seedance 2.0
- `bytedance/seedance-2.0` now accepts `resolution: "4K"` and renders **true 3840×2160** (re-verified with ffprobe). Billed at **9× the 720p token rate** (area-proportional, same basis as 1080p=2.25×).
- 4K is **seedance-2.0 only** — `seedance-1.5-pro` and `seedance-2.0-fast` still cap at `1080p`/`1K` and return `400` for `4K`. `2K` remains unavailable on all Seedance models (not produced upstream).

### Changed — Seedance video max duration raised
- `bytedance/seedance-2.0` and `bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast`: max duration **10s → 15s**.
- `bytedance/seedance-1.5-pro`: max duration **10s → 12s**.
- Default duration stays 5s; price scales linearly with duration (Seedance is token-metered, so a 15s clip costs 3× a 5s clip at the same resolution). Marketplace copy updated from "5–10s" to "5–15s".

---

## [2026-06-22]

### Added — Cache and reasoning tokens surfaced in usage fields
- Non-stream Claude (`/v1/messages` and OpenAI-compat) responses now emit `cached_creation_tokens` (cache-write count) under `prompt_tokens_details`.
- Streaming responses now surface `reasoning_tokens` under `completion_tokens_details`.
- Pricing is unchanged — these fields are reporting-only so callers can reconcile their own ledger 1:1 against ours.

---

## [2026-06-18]

### Changed — `context_management` now requires the `anthropic-beta` header
- **`/v1/messages`**: sending `context_management` without the `anthropic-beta` header now returns a **400 at the gateway edge** (previously the field passed through and silently degraded). Add the `anthropic-beta` header when using `context_management`.

### Changed — Rejected sampling params stripped on native Claude paths
- Opus 4.7 / Opus 4.8 reject `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k`. These params are now stripped on the native `/v1/messages` path so the request stays native (keeps cache fields and the native `msg_` id) instead of falling back to a lossy path. The params are dropped, not honored, for those two models.

### Changed — Model identity injection defaults off
- The system-prompt model-identity directive is no longer appended by default (it had been adding ~40–130 phantom billed input tokens). Reconciled `input_tokens` now matches exactly what you sent.

---

## [2026-06-17]

### Models — GLM-5.2 added as Z.AI flagship
- **Added `zai/glm-5.2`** — **1M-token context**, 262,144 max output, pricing **$1.40/M in · $4.40/M out** ($0.26/M cached). Now featured on the homepage models strip.
- `gpt-5.1` / `gpt-5-pro` routing corrected so those ids serve the genuine models rather than a substitute.

---

## [2026-06-12]

### Models — Kimi K2.7 added as Moonshot flagship
- **Added `moonshot/kimi-k2.7`** — **256K context**, image + video input, returns `reasoning_content`. Pricing **$0.95/M in · $4.00/M out**. Earlier Kimi versions remain routable but are hidden from the public list.

### Added — Video `input_type` param + `usage` block on Seedance responses
- `/api/v1/videos/generations` accepts an optional validated `input_type` enum (`text | image | first_last_frame | reference`); when supplied it must match the seed fields actually sent, otherwise the request returns a 400 before any charge.
- Completed video poll responses now include a `usage` block (`total_tokens`).

### Added — Per-call completion id for 1:1 reconciliation
- Chat responses now carry the completion id (`chatcmpl-…` / `msg_…`) and image/video responses carry a per-call id, surfaced publicly as `id`, so payers can join their ledger to ours.

---

## [2026-05-24 — late]

### Changed — Virtual Portrait enrollment dropped to $0.01 (parity with RealFace)
- **`POST /api/v1/portrait/enroll`**: $0.50 → **$0.01 USDC**. Token360 charges nothing for asset storage, so per-enrollment margin was always trivial; the old $0.50 was friction without offsetting cost. Now matches RealFace pricing — both are 1¢ to encourage adoption, and we make our money on the downstream Seedance per-clip revenue.
- All UI, docs, video-playground tooltips, and asset-storage comments updated to reflect the new price.

## [2026-05-24]

### Added — RealFace enrollment (real-person likeness, no KYC)
- **`POST /api/v1/realface/init`** + **`POST /api/v1/realface/enroll`** — full RealFace flow now live. The rights-holder scans a QR on their phone and completes a brief liveness check (nod + blink, ~1 minute), BlockRun's backend uploads the face photo and waits for an upstream biometric match, returns a `ta_xxxxxx` id usable as `real_face_asset_id` on Seedance 2.0 / 2.0-fast. **$0.01 USDC per enrollment** (promotional pricing), one-time. See [RealFace API reference](../api-reference/realface.md).
- **No KYC required.** No government ID, no account login, no name verification. Only a face-match between the live H5 capture and the photo you supply. Biometric data flows phone → upstream identity service directly, never touches BlockRun servers.
- **`GET /api/v1/realface/status?groupId=…`** — free polling endpoint, used by the studio UI to detect H5 completion.
- **`GET /api/v1/wallet/<address>/realfaces`** — symmetric to `/portraits`, lists a wallet's enrolled RealFaces.
- **[blockrun.ai/studio/realface](https://blockrun.ai/studio/realface)** — web UI: connect wallet → upload image URL → click Start → QR + countdown → poll for H5 completion → sign payment → copy `ta_xxx`.
- **Video playground dropdown** now combines Virtual Portrait + RealFace assets into a single `real_face_asset_id` selector, grouped by type.
- Header **Models** dropdown adds "RealFace Studio".

### Reversed — earlier 2026-05-22 "RealFace removed" entry
- The 2026-05-22 changelog entry "Removed — RealFace" was based on an integration that was blocked by an upstream webhook bug at our inference partner. The partner shipped a fix on 2026-05-24; we verified the end-to-end flow (group active after H5 → photo upload → `ta_xxx` active in 6s → Seedance video generated in 86s using the enrolled face). The original conclusion that RealFace requires KYC was wrong — actual flow is liveness-only (nod + blink), no ID or account binding.

---

## [2026-05-22]

### Added — Virtual Portrait enrollment (no KYC)
- **`POST /api/v1/portrait/enroll`** — $0.50 USDC per enrollment, x402-gated. Registers an AI-generated character image as a Virtual Portrait and returns a `ta_xxxxxx` id usable as `real_face_asset_id` on Seedance 2.0 / 2.0-fast. Settlement happens only after enrollment succeeds — no charge on upload failure. See [Virtual Portrait API reference](../api-reference/virtual-portrait.md).
- **`GET /api/v1/wallet/<address>/portraits`** — lists the portraits a wallet has enrolled. Free, rate-limited (20 req/hr/IP, shared with the wallet-reconciliation bucket).
- **[blockrun.ai/studio/portrait](https://blockrun.ai/studio/portrait)** — web UI: connect wallet → name + image URL → sign → copy `ta_xxx`. Existing portraits listed below the form.
- **Video playground** at `/models/bytedance-seedance-2.0-fast` (and 2.0 Pro) now shows a dropdown of the connected wallet's enrolled portraits instead of asking users to paste a `ta_xxx` manually.
- Header **Models** dropdown now exposes "Portrait Studio".

### ~~Removed — RealFace (real-person likeness) is no longer offered~~ *(reversed on 2026-05-24, see latest entry)*
- ~~BlockRun does not offer real-person likeness in video generation.~~ This conclusion was wrong — upstream had a webhook bug that made the group never transition to active; once fixed, the flow works without KYC. RealFace was reinstated on 2026-05-24.

### Changed — Seedance defaults bumped to 720p + synced audio
- `/api/v1/videos/generations` now defaults `resolution: "720p"` for all Seedance models (was 480p). Override by passing an explicit `resolution` (`360p` / `480p` / `720p` / `1080p`; `1080p` is the max — `2K`/`4K` are rejected with a `400`).
- `/api/v1/videos/generations` now defaults `generate_audio: true` for text-to-video Seedance calls (`false` for image-conditioned or `real_face_asset_id` calls, where audio defaults are off per upstream guidance). Pass an explicit boolean to override.
- Output now matches JiMeng / BytePlus directly — same resolution, same multimodal audio path. Per-clip cost ≈ 2× the old 480p baseline because Seedance meters by tokens and 720p doubles the per-second count.
- Updated pricing table: **$0.46 / $1.19 / $1.49** per 5s 720p clip for 1.5-pro / 2.0-fast / 2.0 (was $0.22 / $0.57 / $0.71 at 480p, text-to-video).
- `tokensPerSecondAtDefault` updated to **20,256** in the model catalog (was 10,128).

### Fixed — Seedance copyright-filter UX
- The video playground now distinguishes Seedance's content-policy rejections from generic errors. On rejection, users see a clear "You were not charged" message + suggestions (rephrase with generic descriptors, switch to Grok Imagine Video, or enroll a Virtual Portrait for consistent characters).

## [2026-05-18]

### Added — Surf crypto data partnership
- **`/api/v1/surf/*`** — 83 crypto data endpoints in three flat price tiers ($0.001 / $0.005 / $0.02), covering CEX prices, on-chain SQL (sub-second ClickHouse, 80+ tables), Polymarket/Kalshi/dFlow prediction markets, wallet labels (smart-money, KOL, exchange), social mindshare, AI-curated news, and project/fund/token/wallet search. Payment settles 1:1 directly to Surf's treasury — BlockRun takes no margin in exchange for being the discovery + x402 layer. See [Surf API reference](../api-reference/surf.md).
- **`blockrun_surf` MCP tool** added to the BlockRun MCP server.
- Surf added as a partner in [Ecosystem](ecosystem.md).

### Added — Phone & Voice partnership (Bland.ai + Twilio)
- **`/api/v1/voice/call`** — outbound AI conversation calls. **$0.54 flat per call** (up to 30 min, default 5 min). Bland.ai upstream.
- **`/api/v1/phone/numbers/buy`** — provision a wallet-owned US/CA phone number for $5 (30-day lease). Twilio upstream. Ownership recorded in Firestore against the calling wallet — only that wallet can use the number as caller ID or renew it.
- **`/api/v1/phone/numbers/renew`** — extend lease by 30 days for $5.
- **`/api/v1/phone/numbers/list`** — list a wallet's active numbers.
- **`GET /api/v1/voice/call/{id}`** — free polling endpoint for call status / transcript / recording.
- See [Phone & Voice API reference](../api-reference/voice-phone.md).

### Added — BytePlus RealFace for Seedance video *(deprecated 2026-05-22 — see [Removed](#removed--realface-real-person-likeness-is-no-longer-offered))*
- `bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast` and `bytedance/seedance-2.0` now accept a `real_face_asset_id` parameter (`ta_xxxxxx` format) for face-reference image-to-video. Asset IDs are managed in BytePlus's RealFace catalog.
- **Superseded by [Virtual Portrait enrollment](../api-reference/virtual-portrait.md) (2026-05-22)** — the API field name is preserved, but the only supported asset type is now a BlockRun-issued Virtual Portrait (`POST /v1/portrait/enroll`). Real-person likeness is not offered.

### Added — Brand: Franklin → Franklin Agent
- Renamed the autonomous-agent product across the entire site, docs, and SDKs. Repo (`BlockRunAI/Franklin`) and CSS unchanged; surface copy now consistently says "Franklin Agent" to disambiguate from the personal name.

### Changed — Seedance pricing migrated to per-M-token
- Old per-second pricing ($0.03–$0.30 / sec) is deprecated. New per-M-token pricing aligned with token360 upstream:
  - `seedance-1.5-pro`: $4.32/M tokens (flat, 480p default)
  - `seedance-2.0-fast`: $11.20/M (text-only) or $6.60/M (with image input)
  - `seedance-2.0`: $14/M (text-only) or $8.60/M (with image input)
- Default resolution is 480p (token360 default). Effective rate at 10,128 tok/sec.

### Added — Rate-limit transparency
- 429 responses now carry `Retry-After` (RFC-7231 standard) + `X-RateLimit-Source: <provider>` headers, plus body fields `code: "RATE_LIMITED"`, `source`, `retry_after_seconds`. Clients can fail over to a same-tier model on a different provider, or honor the retry interval. See [Rate Limits](../api-reference/rate-limits.md) — there is no platform-side QPS/RPM/TPM quota on paid inference; upstream provider limits apply.

## [2026-04-25]

### Models
- **Added `openai/gpt-5.5`** — released 2026-04-23, first fully retrained base since GPT-4.5. 1M context, 128K output, native agent + computer use. Pricing: $5.00 / $30.00 per 1M tokens.
- Promoted `openai/gpt-5.5` to `FEATURED_MODEL_IDS` (replaces `openai/gpt-5.4` as the OpenAI flagship surfaced on the homepage and discover pages).

### SDK Updates
- Python SDK (`blockrun-llm`) **0.17.0**: `PREMIUM_TIERS["MEDIUM"]` primary now `openai/gpt-5.5`; `gpt-5.4` demoted to first fallback. `estimate_cost` baseline rebased from $2.50/$15 to $5.00/$30 to match the new flagship. `__version__` and `VERSION` reconciled (was 0.16.1 vs 0.15.0).
- TypeScript SDK (`@blockrun/llm`) **1.11.0**: catalog refreshed with `openai/gpt-5.5`. `VERSION` and `package.json` reconciled (was 1.9.0 vs 1.10.1).
- Go SDK (`blockrun-llm-go`) **0.4.0**: `RoutingPremium.TierMedium` primary now `openai/gpt-5.5` (was `gpt-5.4`).

## [2026-04-17]

### Added — xAI Grok Imagine
- **Video generation** — new endpoint `POST /api/v1/videos/generations` with `xai/grok-imagine-video` ($0.050/sec, 8-second clips, text or image-to-video). The endpoint handles xAI's async job + polling internally so callers get the MP4 URL in a single request. See [Video Generation](../api-reference/video-generation.md).
- **Grok Imagine image models** — `xai/grok-imagine-image` ($0.02/image) and `xai/grok-imagine-image-pro` ($0.07/image) added to `POST /api/v1/images/generations`.
- **Grok 4.20 chat models** (hidden, API-routable) — `xai/grok-4.20-reasoning`, `xai/grok-4.20-non-reasoning`, `xai/grok-4.20-multi-agent`. 2M context, vision-capable, $2/M in · $6/M out.

### Added — Permanent media URLs via GCS backup
- Every generated image and video is now mirrored to BlockRun's Google Cloud Storage bucket and returned through a blockrun-hosted proxy URL (`/api/media/...`). Upstream URLs from `imgen.x.ai` and `vidgen.x.ai` are temporary — the returned `url` is permanent.
- Image/video responses now include:
  - `url` — permanent proxy URL (falls back to upstream if the backup step fails)
  - `source_url` — original upstream URL (for debugging / comparison)
  - `backed_up` — boolean indicating whether GCS mirroring succeeded

### API Changes
- `GET /api/v1/models` now includes video models with `billing_mode: "per_second"` and `pricing: { per_second, default_duration_seconds, max_duration_seconds }`.

---
