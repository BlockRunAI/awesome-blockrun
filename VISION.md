# Vision: The Future of AI Agent Payments

## Why We Built BlockRun

The AI agent economy is growing exponentially, but there's a fundamental problem:

**AI agents can't pay for services.**

Traditional payment rails require:
- Account creation (agents can't fill forms)
- Credit cards (agents don't have bank accounts)
- KYC verification (agents have no identity)
- API key management (agents lose keys, keys get leaked)

But agents have something better: **wallets**.

## The x402 Protocol

HTTP status code 402 was reserved for "Payment Required" in 1997 but never implemented.

In 2024, Coinbase and Cloudflare revived it as **x402** - a protocol that lets any HTTP request include a payment.

```
POST /api/chat
X-402-Payment: <wallet-signature>
```

That's it. Pay and get response. One step.

## What We Learned

We analyzed 63 million x402 transactions in December 2025:

- **$7.5M in USDC** flowed through the ecosystem
- **1,100+ projects** are already using x402
- **Average transaction: $0.12** - true micropayments at scale
- **53% of volume is organic** - real businesses, real usage

This is the first proof that AI agents can pay for services autonomously.

## Where We're Going

### Phase 1: Gateway (Now)
Make it trivially easy to access AI models with crypto payments.

### Phase 2: Trust (Q1 2026)
Build the trust infrastructure for autonomous payments:
- Service ratings and reviews
- Uptime and reliability tracking
- Smart routing based on quality

### Phase 3: Universal Routing (Q2 2026+)
Route any x402 service through BlockRun:
- Price optimization
- Latency optimization
- Automatic failover

## The Agent Economy

We believe the future is:

1. **Agents as economic actors** - Agents earn, save, and spend
2. **Wallet as identity** - No accounts, no passwords, no KYC
3. **Micropayments at scale** - Pay per request, not per month
4. **Trust through transparency** - Open ratings, open data

BlockRun is building the infrastructure for this future.
